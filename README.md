# Boston Dynamics Spot: Earth Shoveling Project

## Project Overview

In this project, students will equip the Boston Dynamics quadruped robot, Spot, to perform the task of moving earth with a shovel. The challenge is to design and implement a system that allows the robot to interact with a simulated environment containing earth and rocks, which may be hidden, making the task of shoveling more complex. The robot will need to be capable of using a shovel to scoop earth and move around to select optimal locations for digging.

The project will focus on overcoming the difficulties posed by hidden rocks and developing a robust approach for successful shoveling. This may involve either a machine learning-based method or a clever programming solution. The key tasks will include robotic manipulation, movement control, and obstacle detection, all requiring a strong grasp of robotics, Python programming, and possibly machine learning techniques.

## Key Skills & Technologies

- **Robotic Manipulation:** Understanding how to control the robot's shovel and use it effectively for earth movement.
- **ROS (Robot Operating System):** Leveraging ROS to control the Spot robot and interface with the various sensors and actuators.
- **Python Programming:** Writing the necessary code to implement the robot's behavior and logic.
- **Machine Learning (Optional):** If a machine learning-based approach is chosen, knowledge of machine learning will be required to design algorithms for obstacle detection, rock identification, and path planning.

## Objectives

- Equip the Spot robot with a shovel.
- Design a system for moving earth, avoiding hidden rocks, and selecting optimal digging spots.
- Implement robot movement and manipulation using ROS and Python.
- Optionally, integrate machine learning to handle environmental complexity, such as detecting and avoiding rocks.

## Setup

1. **Hardware:** Boston Dynamics Spot robot, shovel attachment.
2. **Software:** ROS, Python, Machine Learning libraries (if applicable).
3. **Environment:** A simulated environment with earth and rocks (could be a mock setup).

## Project Challenges

- Hidden rocks that make shoveling difficult.
- Identifying optimal locations for digging.
- Ensuring smooth interaction between the robot and its environment.
- Managing the complexity of robotic manipulation with precise movement and control.

## Getting Started

To begin, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the installation guide. Ensure that you have ROS set up and configured for the Spot robot. The machine learning component (if applicable) will require additional libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
